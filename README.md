# cost-of-living-analytics
Overview
This project analyzes the Cost of Living Index (2024 Mid-Year) dataset to create meaningful insights and visualizations. Through data analysis and storytelling techniques, the project addresses key questions relevant to expatriates, digital nomads, and companies seeking relocation options. The insights are tailored to support budget planning, identify ideal destinations, and compare global regions in terms of living costs.

Dataset
Source
The dataset used in this project is the Cost of Living Index (2024 Mid-Year), sourced from Kaggle and based on data from Numbeo.

Description
The dataset includes detailed cost-of-living metrics for countries worldwide, providing insight into expenses such as groceries, rent, restaurant prices, and local purchasing power. The indices are normalized to a base value of 100, equivalent to the cost of living in New York City, USA.

Data Dictionary
Field Name	Data Type	Description
Rank	Integer	Ranks countries from highest to lowest cost of living.
Country	String	Name of the country.
Cost of Living Index	Float	Relative living cost index compared to New York City (base value: 100).
Rent Index	Float	Relative rent costs in each country.
Cost of Living Plus Rent Index	Float	Combined measure of living and rent costs.
Groceries Index	Float	Relative grocery costs.
Restaurant Price Index	Float	Relative dining costs.
Local Purchasing Power Index	Float	Relative purchasing power of local residents.
Contextual Example
An index of 100 represents the cost of living in New York City.
Example: In NYC, a family of four's estimated monthly cost (excluding rent) is $6,074.40, while a single person's cost is $1,640.90 (Numbeo, 2024).
Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to provide actionable insights from the Cost of Living dataset through visual storytelling. The project seeks to answer the following questions:

Helping Expats: Which countries are ideal for expatriates based on their budget?
Digital Nomads: What are the best countries for digital nomads seeking affordable yet comfortable living?
Corporate Relocation: How do living costs affect companies considering relocation?
Regional Comparisons: How do the cost of living indices compare across global regions?
